This file is now the amalgamated list of authors, contributors and credits
for Doom64 EX. Hopefully by keeping these all in one place, they will remain
more accurate.

Doom was originally written by id software; when playing with any id main
wad file, you can see their list of credits, which includes the list of
programmers. After some years, they released the source code, to allow
others to work on improving the game.

In October 1999, id Software re-released the Doom source code under the
GNU General Public License.

Samuel 'Kaiser' Villarreal <svkaiser@gmail.com>
Doom64 EX Author

Paul Brook
For originally creating the Doom3D source port for Doom and Doom2. Only to have it
ripped apart by Kaiser :-)

James "Quasar" Haley <haleyjd@hotmail.com>
For providing wisdom when it comes to working with all the backend stuff such as
Doom's zone memory allocator. Also provided the macro script compiler utility.

Lee Killough
For just about anything that fixed all of Doom's mistakes, bugs, and errors.

Team TNT
For all Boom related enhancements and fixes.

Josh.W
For being the original Doom64 USF ripper. Without his knowledge on the USF format,
Doom64 EX's music wouldn't be possible without some form of bulky mp3 files.

Adam Gashlin
For everything N64 and USF related. http://www.hcs64.com/
